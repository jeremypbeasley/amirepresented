# Am I Represented?

A web app that allows the user to input a zip code and return local representatives, their twitter handles, and their websites. Find out who represents you and tell ‘em what you think.

### The inner workings

Our app is built on `node.js`. We’re also `grunt` to compile `stylus` and concatonate our JavaScript. We get all our representative info from Google’s Civic Information API.

To run this app locally, install `node`, `npm`, and `bower` from the command line. Then you can run `npm install` and `bower install` for any dependencies you’ll need.

To begin working, run `grunt` and `npm start` in separate command line tabs. You can see the app locally at http://localhost:7000/.
